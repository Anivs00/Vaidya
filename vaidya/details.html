<p> Being the centre of our world, our homes should naturally reflect our personalities, and be a source of calm and tranquillity.
    <br>
    This is not always easy to achieve when materialistic clutter and day-to-day stresses are brought into this space; further aggravating our anxieties and affecting our mental, emotional, and physical health.
    <br>
Fortunately, Ayurveda offers practical solutions to help us design a home that is the perfect embodiment of our ultimate safe space.

With the teachings of Ayurveda and the principles of Vastu, here’s a quick look at the ways in which, you too, can create the ideal Ayurvedic home environment to bring health and happiness back into your homes.

</p>
<p class="con-1">What is Ayurveda?</p>

Ayurveda, or Ayurvedic medicine, is an ancient system of healing that focuses on restoring balance within the body and mind in order to achieve optimal health. With an emphasis on promoting healthy living rather than simply curing the symptoms of diseases, the natural and holistic approach of Ayurveda has gained widespread prominence and is quickly becoming a go-to measure for those seeking an alternative to run-of-the-mill treatments.

<p class="con-1">Ayurveda and Your Home</p>
Though primarily thought of as a system of medicine, Ayurveda is so much more than that. Literally meaning ‘the science of life’, Ayurveda encompasses everything from our diets to our daily routines to create the most perfect system of bringing harmony and balance to our lives. And this includes our environments too.
Our homes, should therefore naturally be a place of peace and calm amidst the chaos. Ayurveda provides simple, manageable, and handy tips that allow us to design the ideal space that is a true representation of optimal living.

<p class="con-1">Ayurvedic Principles for the Home</p>
From Ayurveda, comes Vastu Shastra, or the ‘science of architecture’. Vastu Shastra is often referred to as Indian Feng Shui and outlines the principles related to the architecture of our living or working spaces. This includes the design, layout, measurements, and spatial arrangements that allow you to create spaces that promote health, prosperity, and clarity.
Some of these tips and guidelines include:

<p class="con-1">1. Choose colours with care</p>
It’s more than simply about the aesthetic. The colour palette plays a pivotal role in the creation of a warm, happy, and positive space.
Neutral, earthy tones such as beige, lavender, light blue, and yellow are ideal for the bedroom to promote a restful night’s sleep. While white and bright colours with warm tones should always be able to find a place in your home.

<p class="con-1">2. Declutter</p>
The clutter that we collect, in hopes of someday finding use for it, actually acts as a hindrance to moving forward. It also triggers stress and overstimulation; not exactly the emotions you want to associate with in your home.
Decluttering, especially under the bed, brings with it physical, emotional, and mental peace. Following Marie Kondo’s example, stick with the things that bring you enjoy, and discard the rest.

<p class="con-1">3. Know your plants</p>
Indoor plants are a great design option and help bring in colour and life to your home. But be selective in your choice of plants.
Spikey and thorny plants such as cacti tend to bring in negative energy, and are best restricted near back doors. Instead, opt for succulents such as Jade plants (Money plants) which symbolise abundance and positivity.

<p class="con-1">4. Optimise ventilation and natural light</p>
Obvious as it may seem, it needs to be said. There is nothing as effective as getting rid of negative energy as a breath of fresh air.
Keeping your doors and windows open allows for a constant circulation that removes stale air and moisture from the home.

<p class="con-1">5. Harmonise the design and layout</p>
These are the big things, but the important things. A crucial part of Vastu lies in designing the home to optimise the health and productivity of its occupants. This means that the placement of the rooms and orientation of the home should harmonise with nature, mainly the suns direction.
For instance, the main entrance of the home should face eastward to receive the nourishing rays of the sun. Similarly, the bedrooms must ideally be placed on the west side, while the kitchen should be in the southeast.

<p class="con-1">6. Make the small changes</p>
These changes may seem small, and even trivial, but they do create a lasting impact on the energy within the home. For example:
Place tinkling bells or wind chimes at the entrance of your home
Move your bedroom mirror so that it doesn’t reflect the bed
Place a nameplate on your doorway
Opt for breathable fabrics such as cotton or linen in place of synthetic fibres for your bedding and upholstery
These simple tricks act as a remedy for shattering and releasing negative energy while attracting peace, positivity, and prosperity.

<p class="con-1">7. Use aromatherapy</p>
Known to reduce stress, boost immunity, and promote relaxation, aromatherapy is an incredible healing system that boasts of numerous applications and benefits. The use of essential oils, diffuses, and aroma candles, are therefore the perfect addition to your home to create the ideal space of rest and tranquillity.

<p class="con-1">Conclusion</p>
Being a truly holistic healing philosophy, it is no wonder that Ayurveda takes into consideration the impact of our homes and environment on our overall health and wellbeing. And by practicing this long-ago acquired wisdom, we too can achieve the ultimate balance of mind and body.
Vastu not only helps create the perfect space, but it also helps us enhance the connection between ourselves and our homes, while bringing positive energy into them.
Perhaps most importantly, vastu also takes into account our specific doshas, the suns orientation at different times of the day, and the layout of our homes, to design a unique space that optimises both our health and our potential.
