            <b> Why we are so concern about "Ayurveda"? </b> 
            <br>
            <br>
            Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine that originated in India more than 5,000 years ago. The word
            "Ayurveda" is derived from the Sanskrit words "Ayus" (life) and "Veda" (knowledge or science). Ayurveda is
            based
            on the belief that the body, mind, and spirit are interconnected and that a balance between these elements
            is
            essential for good health
            <br>
            Ayurveda uses natural remedies and treatments, such as herbal medicines, massage, and dietary changes, to
            promote health and prevent and treat illness. Ayurvedic practitioners believe that each person has a unique
            body
            type, or "dosha," which influences their physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and predispositions
            to
            certain health conditions. Ayurvedic treatments are tailored to each individual's dosha.
            <br>
            Ayurveda is recognized as a complementary and alternative medicine in many countries, and it is becoming
            increasingly popular in the West as people seek out holistic approaches to healthcare. However, it is
            important
            to note that Ayurvedic treatments should always be undertaken under the guidance of a qualified
            practitioner, as
            some remedies may interact with other medications or have potential side effects.
